# Miss Pan's Bakery - Full Stack Frameworks with Django Milestone Project
<https://miss-pans-bakery.herokuapp.com/>
## Overview
For the fourth and final project of my Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer course, I was tasked with building a full-stack site using the Django web framework. The project required
business logic and a user authentication system, which allow the user to create a log in and pay for services using Stripe. The final project was the largest and combined elements
from the previous three projects, with the significant addition being the use of Django. In Django, I needed to split my work into different apps and make use of the model-template-views
pattern. This meant designing a relational database backend, writing views in Python and creating frontend templates in HTML featuring template logic.

I decided to build a bakery website, with its primary purpose being to sell products from its shop. The shop app allows users to browse products and view details about them.
This also meant building a shopping cart and an orders app, allowing users to add products to their cart and submit an order after completing a payment using Stripe. Furthermore, users
can add product reviews for products if they have purchased the product.

In addition to the shop and ordering functionality, there is a recipes app where users can browse and create recipes, and click the heart button to save them to their user profile.
There is also a videos app where admins can add embedded YouTube videos for users to watch on the site, and a gallery app where admins can upload images to an image gallery and users
can switch between viewing the uploaded images and images of products in the shop. Users also have their own profile where they can view order history, their created and hearted recipes,
and update their default delivery information.

The website is responsive across devices, largely due to use of the Bootstrap CSS framework. I have also made use of JQuery to improve the user experience. Media and static files are
stored externally in an Amazon Web Services S3 bucket, and the website is deployed to Heroku [here](https://miss-pans-bakery.herokuapp.com/).
